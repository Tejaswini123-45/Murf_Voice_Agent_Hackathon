## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "Does it work with real banks?"**
A: "Currently it's a prototype with simulated data, but the architecture is designed to integrate with real banking APIs. The RESTful API structure makes it easy to connect to any backend."

**Q: "How accurate is the voice recognition?"**
A: "With Deepgram's Nova-2 model, we get 95%+ accuracy. For the demo, we're using a fallback mode, but with API keys, it uses professional-grade STT."

**Q: "What about security?"**
A: "Great question! For production, we'd add: voice biometrics for authentication, end-to-end encryption, secure token-based auth, and audit logging. The architecture supports all of these."

**Q: "Can it handle multiple languages?"**
A: "The current version is English-only, but the AI models support 100+ languages. It's just a configuration change to add multi-language support."

**Q: "How does anomaly detection work?"**
A: "We calculate statistical baselines for each category - average spending, standard deviation. Transactions that are 2+ standard deviations above the mean are flagged as anomalies."

**Q: "What's the latency?"**
A: "In demo mode: 1-2 seconds. With real APIs: 4-6 seconds end-to-end. We can optimize further with streaming responses and parallel processing."

**Q: "Can it scale?"**
A: "Absolutely! The modular architecture, RESTful API design, and database-driven approach make it easy to scale horizontally. We can add caching, load balancing, and microservices as needed."
